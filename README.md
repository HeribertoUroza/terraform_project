## This project is to create a Terraform Module to spin up a EKS cluster and display a simple NGINX app

### Step 1
Utilize `.gitignore` file to hide config files with AWS Credentials.

### Step 2
Create VPC. Needs EKS parameters.

### Step 3
Create IGW. 

### Step 4
Create 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets. Each set will be in different AZ's.   
EKS parameter needed for public subnet(map_public_ip_on_launch) 
Both public and private need (tags/kubernetes.io/cluster/eks).
Public needs (tags/kubernetes.io/role/elb).
Private needs (tags/kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb).

### Step 5 
Create Elastic IP address resource. These elastic IP's will connect to internet throught NAT gateways. 

### Step 6 
Create 2 NAT gateways and place with public subnets. 

### Step 7 
Create 3 Route Tables. 1 Public 2 Private </br> 
Public Route Table => Desination: 0.0.0.0/0 Target: IGW </br> 
Private Route Table => Desination: 0.0.0.0/0 Target: NAT </br>
Private Route Table => Desination: 0.0.0.0/0 Target: NAT </br>
VPC Peering Route Table  => Desination: 10.0.0.0/0 Target: VPC peering connection ID

### Step 8
Create 4 Route Table associations for the 4 different subnets
2 RT associations will be the public subnet to the same Public RT
Each private RT association will be with it own NAT gateway

### Step 9 
Create IAM role needed with eks policy. Next attach policy to eks cluster name

### Step 10
 Create EKS Cluster. 
 - Specify IAM role. 
 - Configure VPC parameters and Subnet ID's need to be declared

### Step 11 
- Create IAM role for EKS node groups. 
- Attach IAM policies to roles. 3 Policies needed and need to be attached. 
Create Instant Groups/EKS node groups. 

Create actual instance groups

### Step 12 
Connect to the cluster with `aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name <NAME_OF_CLUTSER> --profile <NAME_OF_PROFILE>` .I dont have a profile set up with aws cli, will attempt with terraform file first. I was unable to figure it out. Created a profile with `aws configure --profile terraform` to connect to cluster.
- To test successful conneciton `kubectl get svc`

### Step 13
Create simple app with YAML file that utilizes nginx. 
- In YAML file, annotations section help configure Internal Load Balancer. `Type: nlb  Cross-Zone: True  Internal: 0.0.0.0/0`
- Use YAML file to create resources in Kubernetes with `kubectl apply -f <file path>`
- Check resources/pods `kubectl get pods`
- Check services `kubectl get svc`
- Get specific details on a service `kubectl describe svc <NAME OF SERVICE>`
- Create External Load Balancer next with similar steps above
- If it all works, you should be able to see the NGINX site with the external LB's External-IP

-- TROUBLESHOOTING
- (.tf vs .tfvars) For variable files, to normally declare use `.tf` extension. If you would like to overwrite some of the varables, use `terraform apply -var-file="<FILE>.tfvars" `. The `.tfvars` extension can not declare new variables, only rewrite existing.
- (YAML LB's) Make sure subnet tags have the required information so LB's can find them
- Recieved the below error. At first suspected a typo in the subnet resource creation. Actual issue was a wrong attribute in the route table & route table association was pointing at wrong subnet </br>
`Error: error waiting for EKS Node Group (aws_eks_cluster:EKS_nodes) to create: unexpected state 'CREATE_FAILED', wanted target 'ACTIVE'. last error: 1 error occurred:
â”‚       * subnet-0f83213b797278eeb, subnet-02f2ee962cdb9bef0: Ec2SubnetInvalidConfiguration: One or more Amazon EC2 Subnets of [subnet-0f83213b797278eeb, subnet-02f2ee962cdb9bef0] for node group EKS_nodes does not automatically assign public IP addresses to instances launched into it. If you want your instances to be assigned a public IP address, then you need to enable auto-assign public IP address for the subnet. See IP addressing in VPC guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html#subnet-public-ip`
- For ELB, I recieved a `<PENDING>` error. Subnets needed aws_eks name inside of resource, not the one when its declared.
- Ran into issue where nginx site was not displaying and there was no error with the load balencers. I could find any error message from the NGINX side or the EKS side. Finally found that the instance node size was too small. Used t2.micro thinking it would be fine but t3.small was needed as the node.
